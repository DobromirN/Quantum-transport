AB_4-dot contains the most relevant 4 dot results, analytical expressions
AB_4-dot contains the results of coupling to neighbouring dots

The different 4 dot case doesn't help in breaking the symmetry. 
Why? It should. 



AB_N code solves the N-dot case
AB_N_20 shows that the transmission is ok for fr close to 0.5
AB_N_15_fr, AB_N_20_fr show that for small fr the transmission becomes negative i.e. something is wrong.



The attached plots are to see the general tendency with changing the phi - with phi increasing the gap between peaks increases.
